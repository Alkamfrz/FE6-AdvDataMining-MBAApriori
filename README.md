# Market Basket Analysis with Apriori Algorithm

This project demonstrates the use of the Apriori algorithm for market basket analysis. The Apriori algorithm is utilized to uncover relationships between items in large datasets, commonly used in retail to identify frequently bought items together.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need Python installed on your system. The project uses the `pandas` library for data manipulation and the `mlxtend` library for applying the Apriori algorithm and generating association rules.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- mlxtend

### Installation

First, clone this repository to your local machine. Then, install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The project contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the use of the Apriori algorithm for market basket analysis. You can run the notebook and follow along with the code to understand how the algorithm works and how to apply it to your own datasets.
